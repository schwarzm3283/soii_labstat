Occupational injury and illness counts and incidence rates 
are annual measures of the level and frequency of work-related injuries and 
illnesses.  The rate equals the form of the number of injuries and illnesses 
per 100 full-time employees. 

Data collected through the annual survey are based on records which employers 
maintain under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  Data include all cases 
resulting from accidents or exposure in the work environment that result in a 
nonfatal illness or injury.  Some of these cases involve lost work time-- the 
incident may result in a work absence, restriction of work or motion, or 
transfer to another job.  Other recordable cases do not involve any lost days. 
Recordkeeping guidelines are maintained by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration.

Virtually the entire private sector is covered by the survey, except 
self-employed individuals, farms with fewer than 11 employees, and employers 
regulated by other Federal safety and health laws.  National estimates 
exclude Federal, State, and local government agencies, but data for selected 
States include State and local government.  Data conforming to definitions of 
recordable occupational injuries and illnesses for coal, metal and nonmetal 
mining, and railroad transportation are provided by the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, and the Federal Railroad Administration, 
U.S. Department of Transportation.

The incidence rates are produced for industries which are based on the 2012 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The survey sample design 
uses stratified random sample with a Neyman allocation.  The characteristics used
to stratify the units are the States, NAICS code, and employment. The data for all 
reporting units in each industry are expanded by the inverse of the sampling
ratio, and benchmarked to the appropriate employment level in each industry.  
Reports are collected from about 180,000 sample units.

Summary Data Available:  Incidence rates and counts are calculated for three 
categories for total recordable cases:  (1)  injury and illness combined, 
(2)  injury only; and (3)  illness only.

Additionally, estimates of incidence rates and case counts are also available 
for various severity classifications.  For each injuries and illnesses in each 
industry, the incidence rates and numbers of cases are available for total nonfatal 
recordable cases; cases with days away from work, job transfer or restriction; 
cases with days away from work; cases with job transfer or restriction only; and 
other recordable cases. 

Data also include rates and numbers of cases, by various illness categories:  
skin diseases or disorders, respiratory conditions, poisonings, hearing loss, 
and all other illnesses. 

Data for an unpublished industry were included in the total for the broader 
industry level of which it is a part.
